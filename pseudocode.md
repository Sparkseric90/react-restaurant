Ohhhhhhh LaLa Restaurant

As a user with the restaurant app i will want to be able to:
    -navigate a site that has a menu with different sections, App, Salads, Dinner etc.
    -be able to see each section separately.
    -of course be able to find something great to eat.

When creating this app I will want to see:
    -Main page for the different sections of the menu.
    -Different cards for each menu section (Apps, Lunch, Dinner, Sides, Desserts)
    -Menu to change with the api for the different sections.
